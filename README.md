# Research Question
How effective is the developed visual model in recognizing protesters, describing their activities, estimating the level of perceived violence, and identifying exhibited emotions in protest images collected from social media platforms? How does the multi-task convolutional neural network perform in classifying the presence of protesters, predicting visual attributes, perceived violence, and exhibited emotions?

# Introduction
In recent years, social media has become a powerful platform for documenting and disseminating images and information about protest movements worldwide. Our project, "Analyzing Social Media Protest Imagery: Multi-Task CNN for Detection, Violence Estimation, and Emotion Recognition," seeks to leverage this wealth of visual data to understand the dynamics of protests better. We aim to develop a robust visual model capable of recognizing protesters, describing their activities, estimating perceived violence, and identifying exhibited emotions in protest images collected from social media platforms. By employing a multi-task convolutional neural network (CNN), we will assess the model's performance in classifying the presence of protesters, predicting visual attributes, and discerning emotional and violent content. Utilizing a dataset comprising geotagged tweets and images from 2013 to 2017, annotated with various attributes, we will process and analyze this data to uncover insights into protest activities. Our methodology includes advanced image processing, data augmentation, and sentiment analysis techniques, with a structured approach to model training, validation, and optimization. Through this project, we aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of protest imagery, contributing valuable insights into the nature and impact of social movements as captured through the lens of social media.
